# SoftwareGraduationProject

## Project Overview
This project addresses a common issue faced by consumers: the lack of transparency in product and service quality, customer service standards, and overall communication at businesses. Often, customers make purchases without prior knowledge of these aspects, leading to potential dissatisfaction.

The application aims to enhance the shopping experience by providing users with a platform where they can access and contribute to reviews of businesses. Users can share their experiences, helping others make informed decisions.

For businesses, the project offers a registration-based website where they can monitor customer feedback and gauge satisfaction levels through a comprehensive dashboard. This dashboard includes detailed statistics and charts that provide insights into customer sentiment. Additionally, an AI model analyzes feedback, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral, further aiding businesses in understanding and improving their services.

Furthermore, the platform enables businesses to post updates, effectively promoting their products and services to a wider audience. By bridging the gap between consumers and businesses, the application aims to foster better relationships and improve overall customer satisfaction in the marketplace.
